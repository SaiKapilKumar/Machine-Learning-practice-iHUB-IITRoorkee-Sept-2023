Linear models can be counted among supervised algorithms, which are those algorithms that can formulate predictions on numbers and classes if previously given some correct examples to learn from.

1. Understanding the problem-solving capabilities of machine learning.
2. Identifying the problem domains suitable for a regression model.
3. Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of correlation as a statistical concept.
4. Exploring how correlations are applied in the context of a simple regression model.
5. Understanding when, what, and why to use a regression model in various scenarios.
6. Delving into the essential mathematics involved in gradient descent, a key optimization algorithm used in machine learning.

### Defining a Regression Problem

In mathematical formalism, we call the outcome we want to predict the response or target variable, and we usually label it using the lowercase letter 'y'.
